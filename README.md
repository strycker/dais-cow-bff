# Cow BBF Project

This is a sample data engineering project that tries to answer the question if cow best friends also take their meals together. 

This project has been used for the "[Path to Production: Databricks Project CICD FOR Seamless Inner to Outer Dev Loops](https://www.databricks.com/dataaisummit/session/path-production-databricks-project-cicd-seamless-inner-outer-dev-loops)" talk at DATA+AI Summit 2024 and the "[Bridging the Production Gap: Develop and Deploy Code Easily With IDEs](https://www.databricks.com/dataaisummit/session/bridging-production-gap-develop-and-deploy-code-easily-ides/)" talk at DATA+AI Summit 2023.

For the demo at DAIS 2024, use the `dais24-main` branch for the complete code and the `dais24-stageX` branches for snapshots. For the demo at DAIS 2023, see the `main` branch for the complete code and the `stageX` branches for snapshots
